üëã Hello, Recruiters and Data Enthusiasts! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

About Me
I am a passionate and detail-oriented individual with a strong desire to kickstart my career in the world of data analysis. My journey began with a deep curiosity about uncovering insights from data during my university projects, and it has since evolved into a commitment to leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems.

üöÄ Skills
Data Analysis: Proficient in analyzing and interpreting complex datasets to derive meaningful insights.

Programming Languages: Experienced in Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Data Visualization: Skilled in creating compelling visualizations to effectively communicate findings using tools like Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

SQL: Proficient in querying databases to extract relevant information and perform data transformations.

Statistical Analysis: Familiar with statistical concepts and hypothesis testing to validate findings.

Excel: Advanced skills in Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting.

üå± Learning & Growth
I am committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field of data analysis. Currently, I am exploring working on a project involving real-time data analysis and Learning more of POWER BI.

üìà Projects
Feel free to explore my repositories, where I've worked on projects showcasing my data analysis skills. From exploring public datasets to solving specific business problems, each project reflects my dedication to practical, hands-on experience.

Project 1 Climate Weather involving Big Data: This was my universiy personal Project while studying at Coventry University.
A team of analysts faced the challenge of analyzing a vast amount of forecast data spanning 100 years, totaling 9TB. The initial solution involved sequential processing, but due to time constraints and the continuous influx of new data, this approach proved impractical. The team aimed to process 24 hours of data in under two hours, significantly reducing the overall processing time.

To achieve this goal, the team proposed using big data processing techniques, specifically employing parallel processing. The analogy of a restaurant's growth in staff to handle increased demand was used to explain the concept. In parallel processing, the workload is distributed among multiple processing units, enhancing efficiency.

The code for sequential and parallel processing was explained, highlighting the differences in implementation. The analysis considered factors such as dataset size, the number of datasets, and the desired processing time. The conclusion suggested that approximately 19 processors would be needed to meet the goal of analyzing 24 hours of data in just under two hours.

Project 2 Online Retail Analysis: This comprehensive analysis delves into an extensive dataset of online shopping, unveiling concealed trends and patterns.
We will delve into:
Identifying the most sought-after products: What products are rapidly gaining popularity in the digital marketplace? Analyzing shopping trends: Are there specific periods or months witnessing a surge in sales? Evaluating the geographical origins of shoppers: Which countries demonstrate the highest online expenditure? Recognizing customer loyalty: Who comprises the most dedicated repeat customers?.
